# CS 148 Final Project

This was my final project that helped me get an A+ in the class. I spent many hours carefully making 3D models in blender leveraging the knowledge of computer graphics I gained throughout the course of the class. I then carefully placed them into a scene using lighting components and other advanced Blender features to develop a beautiful image.
